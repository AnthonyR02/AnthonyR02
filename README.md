### Hi everyone and nice to meet you,
Im pretty good with java and C++ epsically but want to expand my knowledge in coding as best as I can and I do it in my free time.
I plan on transferring to Penn after my 2 years at NCC in pursuit of a Computer science degree and personally would love to work with HL7 FHIR
